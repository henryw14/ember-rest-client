# Ember-rest-client

The purpose of this Ember Addon is to provide an easy way to communicate with a server over HTTP without using Ember Data. The addon comes with two services. The first is `http-client`, which serves as a more intuitive wrapper around [ij-ajax](https://github.com/instructure/ic-ajax). This service simply makes http calls and has hooks for building headers.

The second service, `rest-client`, is a customizable wrapper around `http-client` to make communicating with your rest-api far easier. A number of configuration options are available and will be detailed below.
